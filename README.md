This is a MyWebsite 2.0 which is a newer version of my website. 
While the old webstie was written almost puerly by hard typing and without much of any frameworks / libraries,
this website will suposely have more of them. 

The aim is to utilize some cool frameworks, and make the best out of them.
But mostly the website is my sandbox for anything I find curious enough to dig in. 

Here, I will also post some of my previous work, which is all available on my github profile as well.
